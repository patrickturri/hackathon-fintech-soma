# AP2 Sample: User Authorization using Digital Payment Credentials

This sample demonstrates user authentication of a purchase using digital payment
credentials (DPC).

## Scenario

This repository demonstrates a conversational Android shopping assistant. It
features a full user experience, from natural language product discovery
(powered by Gemini) to secure payment using Digital Payment Credentials (DPC).
All backend communication is handled via the A2A protocol.

## Key Actors

This sample consists of:

*   **Shopping Agent:** An Android app that handles user's requests to shop.
*   **Merchant Agent:** An agent that handles product queries from the shopping
    agent and verifies the DPC signature.

## Key Features

*   Purchase with a **Digital Payment Credential (DPC):** A modern, secure
    payment flow using the Android Credential Manager that allows signing over
    the user's intent displayed on a trusted surface.

## Executing the Example

### Setup

1.  **Install Android Studio**

    Download Android Studio from the
    [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install it.
    This will install the Android SDK, JDK, and all other necessary tools needed
    to build and run the Android app.

2.  **Obtain a Google API key from
    [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)**

    Configure this key in the following locations:

    1.  Declare it as an environment variable. This is needed to start the
        merchant agent server.

        ```
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
        ```

    1.  Add it to the local.properties file.

        ```
        echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key" >> samples/android/shopping_assistant/local.properties
        ```

3.  **Add the Android SDK path to the local.properties file.**

    You can find this path in Android Studio under `Settings > Languages &
    Frameworks > Android SDK`

    ```
    echo "sdk.dir=your_path" >> samples/android/shopping_assistant/local.properties
    ```

4.  **Set JAVA_HOME environment variable**

    The Java Development Kit (JDK) is typically installed with Android Studio,
    but does not set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Be sure it is set.

    You can find this path in Android Studio under `Settings > Build, Execution,
    Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle`

    ```
    export JAVA_HOME=your_path
    ```

5.  **Ensure your environment meets
    theÂ [Python sample prerequisites](../../../python).**

6.  **Enable the Enhanced Payment Confirmation UI**

    To experience the most modern and secure payment flow, you must enable a
    required feature flag:

    **Enroll in the
    [Google Play Services Beta Program](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/beta-program):**
    Ensure the Google Account on your test device is enrolled.

7.  **Install the Digital Wallet App (sideloaded)**

    This demo requires a separate digital wallet app ('CM Wallet') to be
    installed on the same device that holds the Digital Payment Credentials.

    1.  Download the
        [latest CM Wallet APK](https://github.com/digitalcredentialsdev/CMWallet/actions?query=branch%3Amain).

    1.  Install the APK and start the app:

        ```
        adb install app-debug.apk
        adb shell am start -n "com.credman.cmwallet/.MainActivity"
        ```

### Execution

A convenience script is included to automatically build, install, and launch the
Android app, and start the local merchant server.

```sh
bash samples/android/scenarios/digital-payment-credentials/run.sh
```

## How to Use the App

1.  Ensure the local Merchant Agent server is running:

    ```
    curl http://localhost:8001/a2a/merchant_agent/.well-known/agent-card.json
    ```

2.  Launch the Shopping Assistant app on your device.

3.  In the app's settings screen, enter the URL for your local merchant server.
    The default URL will be `http://10.0.2.2:8001`.

4.  Click the **Connect** button. The app will fetch the A2A Agent Card from the
    server and initialize the chat session.

5.  You can now start a conversation with the shopping assistant. For example,
    try saying: "I'm looking for a new car."
